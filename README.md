# Learning Ukrainian

Hey there!

This is a simple collection of resources to learn, read, listen and watch Ukrainian.

I started this little collection as I faced continuously misleading directions from standard tools like search engines, video content platforms, book recommendations and music streaming in Russian.

So, here we are, collecting what is reasonable and in Ukrainian :)

### Big Tech 

If you are employed in a big tech, hi! Please, open a process internally to support the Ukrainian language better than you do now. A hint: if you search for something in the internet, or on social networks or elsewhere, with Cyrillic letters, you almost ever end up on Russian content. English and German aren't the same, and we use the same letter, right? Thank you for being so supportive!
